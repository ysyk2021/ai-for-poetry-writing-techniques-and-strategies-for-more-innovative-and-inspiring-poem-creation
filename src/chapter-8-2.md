As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve, the potential for its use in poetry writing is only increasing. In this chapter, we will explore some emerging trends and opportunities for AI-enabled poetry writing that are likely to shape the future of the field.

Natural Language Processing (NLP)
---------------------------------

NLP is a branch of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. NLP has numerous applications in poetry writing, including language analysis, sentiment analysis, and generating personalized suggestions for language use and imagery.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
--------------------------------------

GANs are a type of machine learning algorithm used for generating new content based on existing data. In poetry writing, GANs can be used to generate new poems based on existing works, or to create entirely new styles and forms of poetry.

eXplainable AI (XAI)
--------------------

XAI refers to AI models and techniques that can be easily explained and understood by humans. XAI can be particularly useful in poetry writing, as it can help poets understand how AI-powered tools are generating suggestions and recommendations, allowing them to make more informed decisions about their work.

Collaborative Writing
---------------------

Collaborative writing using AI-powered tools allows multiple writers to work together on a single poem, each contributing their own unique ideas and perspectives. This can lead to more diverse and inclusive poetry, as well as new forms and styles of collaboration.

Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, the future of AI-enabled poetry writing is full of exciting opportunities and possibilities. As NLP, GANs, XAI, and collaborative writing continue to evolve and improve, poets will have access to powerful tools for generating new ideas, exploring new styles, and collaborating with others. With a commitment to ethical and unbiased practices, AI can enhance the creative process of poetry writing while also promoting diversity and inclusivity. The future of poetry writing is waiting to be explored with the help of AI.
